# Household System Overhaul

This document outlines the complete overhaul of the FridgeHero household system to make it robust, GDPR-compliant, and feature-rich.

## 🚀 Overview

The household system has been completely redesigned to address the following issues:
- Missing SQL functions causing fetch errors
- GDPR compliance violations when showing emails
- Incomplete permission system
- Poor error handling and user experience
- Lack of robust member management

## 🔧 Key Improvements

### 1. **GDPR Compliance**
- ✅ Emails are only shown when searched by email
- ✅ Username-based searches hide email addresses
- ✅ Only household owners can see member emails for management
- ✅ Clear data access controls

### 2. **Robust SQL Functions**
All missing database functions have been implemented:

#### `search_users_for_invitation(search_term, household_id)`
- GDPR-compliant user search
- Supports both username and email search
- Excludes current user and shows membership status

#### `accept_household_invitation(invitation_id)`
- Secure invitation acceptance
- Validates user permissions
- Handles member limits and duplicate memberships

#### `decline_household_invitation(invitation_id)`
- Secure invitation decline
- Proper permission validation

#### `get_household_members(household_id)`
- Secure member listing with role-based data access
- Email visibility only for owners

#### `remove_household_member(household_id, member_user_id)`
- Owner-only member removal
- Prevents removing other owners
- Automatic notifications

#### `update_household_settings(household_id, new_name, new_max_members)`
- Owner-only settings management
- Premium feature validation
- Member limit checks

#### `transfer_household_ownership(household_id, new_owner_user_id)`
- Secure ownership transfer
- Automatic role updates
- Database consistency

### 3. **Enhanced Security**
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Function-level permissions
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization

### 4. **Better User Experience**
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Loading states and feedback
